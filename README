This file-type plugin is inspired by the work of the vim-r-plugin
(https://github.com/vim-scripts/Vim-R-plugin.git). To be totally honest, I just adapted
the part Jakson Alves de Aquino (thank you very much) send me and included functions that
create parameters required to start a GRASS GIS session- so it is 95% copy and paste. The
plugin uses the screen-plugin as well and has been tested on my machine only (Ubuntu
12.04). It requires "ipython".
