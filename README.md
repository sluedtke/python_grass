####PYTHON-GRASS PLUGIN FOR (G)VIM

This file-type plugin is inspired by the work of the
[vim-r-plugin]((https://github.com/vim-scripts/Vim-R-plugin.git). To be totally honest, I
just adapted the part Jakson Alves de Aquino ( __thank you very much__ ) send me and included
functions that create parameters required to start a GRASS GIS session - so it is 95% copy
and paste. The plugin uses the screen-plugin as well and has been tested on my machine
only (Ubuntu 12.04). It requires __ipython__ and vim compiled with python support.
